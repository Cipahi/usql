11/11/2014,15:11,SQLGal,@jrowlandjones @AaronBertrand I was so nervous about my d in the first half. I need to stop with these silly bets.
11/11/2014,13:50,SQLGal,@SQLRockstar Now now... I never suggested rusty needles :)

11/11/2014,13:32,SQLRockstar,@jrowlandjones @AaronBertrand @SQLGal What I need most is a win. Luckily @ctesta_oneill is up next for me.
11/11/2014,13:22,jrowlandjones,@SQLRockstar @AaronBertrand @SQLGal Me either but given this is my first attempt at this game that really isn't saying very much.
11/11/2014,13:14,SQLRockstar,@jrowlandjones @AaronBertrand @SQLGal I've never known a league to score a punt return for the defense.
11/11/2014,11:05,jrowlandjones,@AaronBertrand @SQLGal I actually felt quite bad for @SQLRockstar. Not often a player scores for both sides (thank you Mr. Sproles)
11/11/2014,11:04,jrowlandjones,@AaronBertrand  The eagles defence is definitely a fantasy point scoring machine. Isn't that right @SQLGal ...
11/11/2014,03:49,AaronBertrand,I thought @SQLGal did well with Arizona (27 pts). I had 9. @jrowlandjones is currently beating me BY 27. Glad I'm not actually against him.

04/04/2014,01:47,datachick,@davejserrano @SQLGal This a myth of no way to deal with change. Abstraction in design can solve that
04/04/2014,01:45,datachick,@davejserrano @SQLGal All my projects are Agile/Scrum.
04/04/2014,01:45,datachick,@davejserrano @SQLGal That's a process problem. Not a role one
04/04/2014,01:38,SQLGal,@davejserrano @datachick altho I still think 'dancing bubble chart' is much better than 'animated scatter chart'
04/04/2014,01:37,SQLGal,@davejserrano @datachick Abstraction layer - much better term than data-out :) This is why they don't ask me to brand things :)
04/04/2014,01:32,SQLGal,@herdcats I loved it when ppl gave up on 'work life balance' and just said we need to find 'work life integration' ;)
04/04/2014,01:34,herdcats,@SQLGal very well integrated that is 😊
04/04/2014,01:28,davejserrano,@SQLGal @datachick it seems to me the abstraction layer is very important but underlying schema could change frequently?
04/04/2014,01:28,SQLGal,@davejserrano @datachick Both. Karen - what did I miss?
04/04/2014,01:23,SQLGal,@davejserrano Oh... you can do it. you got talents :)

04/04/2014,01:20,SQLGal,@davejserrano @datachick Don't assume they only focus on data-in...
04/04/2014,01:03,SQLGal,@davejserrano @datachick I prefer Supreme Ruler of all data - is that over-reaching?
04/04/2014,01:22,davejserrano,@SQLGal So noted. But that will take a lot of the 140 characters. I will have to be concise with snark
04/04/2014,01:02,davejserrano,@SQLGal @datachick just trying to figure out how the role fits into the agile world. the data archs I knew would freak at 'agile' DBs
04/04/2014,00:05,davejserrano,@SQLGal @datachick it just seems the number of apps created and speed they're created preclude this single potential bottleneck?
03/04/2014,21:20,SQLGal,"@datachick @davejserrano Schema now or schema later, you still have schema"
03/04/2014,23:57,davejserrano,@SQLGal @datachick not meant to incite data-people(is that a sub-species?) I was curious if the 'Queen Of All Data' is a typical role still
03/04/2014,21:16,SQLGal,@datachick @davejserrano You are a rare breed :) In many ways...

30/05/2013,16:12,SQLGal,@owen_omalley Thanks Owen - You are mighty awesome. Will I see you in N'Awlins next week?
30/05/2013,16:11,SQLGal,"@owen_omalley Excellent. That did it. I defined the loc in the add partition, but not the table. I thought the add part took care of it."
30/05/2013,15:42,SQLGal,@owen_omalley Sigh. That's a bummer. So I need to stage first then load? Versus using the insert select?
30/05/2013,15:24,SQLGal,@owen_omalley When I load the data it creates the partitions &amp; stores on the default container. How do I force it to load to my container?
30/05/2013,15:23,SQLGal,@owen_omalley It just won't behave. External table with partitions on asv.
30/05/2013,14:35,SQLGal,@programmersedge It appears that I gave Hive too much leash. Hive needs a more aggressive stance.
30/05/2013,14:34,SQLGal,@AdamMachanic That is pretty strong language! Channel the love and Hive will love you back.
30/05/2013,14:33,SQLGal,"@StrateSQL Yeah, Minnesota Hive is destined to be passive aggressive."
30/05/2013,14:23,SQLGal,C'mon Hive. Be nice. Stop being passive aggressive and tell me why you decided not to listen to me.

05/01/2013,02:13,SQLGal,@onpnt @SQLBoyWonder @grrl_geek What is WRONG with you people? It is COLD out there!
05/01/2013,02:09,SQLGal,@SQLBoyWonder @grrl_geek @onpnt OK. Chuck can no longer play if he keeps taking about polar plunges:-)
05/01/2013,02:08,SQLGal,@joshuafennessy @onpnt @grrl_geek @sqlboywonder Like I said - as long as they can hand the ball to AP all is good. And a kicker can do that
05/01/2013,02:05,SQLGal,@grrl_geek @SQLBoyWonder @onpnt Sigh. OK. That seems warmer than polar plunge.
05/01/2013,02:00,SQLGal,"@SQLBoyWonder @grrl_geek @onpnt Wouldn't you be? &lt;3 my kicker, &lt;3 ap, &lt;3 &lt;3 jared allen. but we have a big variable in the qb."
05/01/2013,01:57,SQLGal,@SQLBoyWonder @grrl_geek @onpnt Love your spirit. But I am cold sitting in my house with 2 sweatshirts and a blanket.
05/01/2013,01:45,SQLGal,"@grrl_geek @onpnt @sqlboywonder Touche:-) Yes, we need a qb. but he does a fine job handing the ball to AP. He just needs to keep doing that"
05/01/2013,01:44,SQLGal,@grrl_geek @onpnt @sqlboywonder He was good for us too. You desparately need a kicker. We need to keep Walsh. 10-10 over 50 yds. Amazing.
05/01/2013,01:40,SQLGal,"@grrl_geek @onpnt @sqlboywonder Check out http://t.co/eENz6rE0 for a few stats. Walsh is #1, where is the packer kicker? Oh.. way down at 24"
