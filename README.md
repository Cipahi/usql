# U-SQL

U-SQL is a new language from Microsoft for processing big data.  U-SQL combines the familiar syntax of SQL with the expressiveness of custom code written in C#, on top of a scale-out runtime that can handle any size data. 

## What is this site? 

This site is the front door to the repo are where you can find libraries, tools and more for extending U-SQL. More importantly, it's a direct line back to the team for bugs, feature requests, suggestions. We will also be placing design proposals and track features coming in upcoming releases. We're super excited about U-SQL, and we hope that you are too.
